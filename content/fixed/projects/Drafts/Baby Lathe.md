### OVERVIEW

I recently purchased a lathe to augment my milling machine. While the mill is excellent at making square(ish) parts, it it not particularly good at making round ones. After trawling Craigslist for months, I finally gave in and bought a mini lathe (7x14") from eBay. It showed up in a wooden crate,  surprisingly well packed.

Unfortunately, when buying a lathe straight from the golden shores of Shanghai for $400, sacrifices must be made. Most of these lathes are basically kits. I guess you could use them as is, but mine was so covered in cosmolime, grit, and dirt that I had to strip it down first.

Some of the surface finishes, especially on the mating parts, leave much to be desired, like (roughly!) flycut dovetails. On the other hand, they spent time where it counts -- the bed grinding is great, even if the paint is basically just drizzled on.

Of course, I immediately set to improving it, as everyone with sub par tools is wont to do. In order of greatest to smallest improvement, weighted by cost:

### BOLT IT DOWN
To anything substantial. By far the biggest upgrade I've noticed yet, and probably the cheapest upgrade. In my experience, not only does it make the lathe more pleasant to work with, but a bit of extra mass reduces chatter and improves surface finish noticeably.

I needed a place to put it, so I welded some shelves into an old propane cage and cast a 160lbs of concrete to anchor the lathe. Now that the stand outweighs the lathe 3:1, the lathe is much nicer to use.

Need to add pics of new bearings, lathe on stand, test part, scraped toolpost, going forward
