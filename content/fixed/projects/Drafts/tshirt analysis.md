### Background

Like every other college student on the planet, I wear a lot of t-shirts. Naturally, I have my favorites, but every shirt eventually wears out. My tees tend to be a hodgepodge of university sponsored swag, random souvenirs, and clothing bought from a smattering of retailers in styles they no longer carry. Needless to say, when a shirt wears out, it's difficult, if not impossible, to find a replacement.

In a world of standardized parts, this simply won't do, so in the interests of frugality and comfort, I've decided to figure out who makes the best, widely available and standardized t-shirt $4 can buy. I'll be looking primarily at longevity, but also price, color range, as well as general fit and finish. I'll build a total score for my shirts, and my thoughts on each one. This is mostly for me, but I hope it helps you find the your new favorite cheap t-shirt.

In my initial survey, I tried to find tees in my closet I loved and use that as a starting point for picking new shirts. By far, the most popular two types were 100% cotton and a 50/50 (sometimes 60/40) mix of cotton and polyester.

100% Cotton Tees are

- cheap
- recyclable and generally eco-friendly
- may shrink, most brands have preshrunk versions
- very soft
- less durable than polyester versions

Cotton / Polyester Tees are

- almost as cheap
- not easily recyclable
- no shrink
- almost as soft
- more durable than 100% cotton

50 / 50 cotton shirts, on the other hand, have a similar fit and feel to cotton tees, but are more durable, wrinkle resistant, and color fast. They don't shrink nearly as much, and generally cost about the same as a cotton tee, maybe a bit more.

I bought ~ 11 shirts from a company called [Shirt Supplier](https://www.shirtsupplier.com/) for $36, including shipping. This is a breakdown of each type of shirt I ordered. I tried to avoid black and white shirts, as the fabric content of those two colors tends to be somewhat different from the other colors. 

I refer to all shirts by their style number, not the style name.

### Initial Impressions

All shirts fit suprisingly well. Every shirt is incredibly soft, with the corsest being the Hanes 5170 (but not by much). Fits and finishes are excellent -- no loose thread in my order at all, and all of the shirts fit almost identically, with the 4980 seeminly running a bit longer. In short, the shirts are basically undifferentiated right now -- time will tell how well each one holds up!

In the future, I would also like to try a few other brands -- Anvil, Fruit of the Loom, Next Level, and LAT.
