_This project is a work in progress_

I'm looking to build a kiln to experiment with dichroic glasses and case hardening of steel and need a work envelope of around 30L. Most kilns intended for pottery or glass tempering are far too large, or require 220V. Given the premium on space and lack of easily available single phase 220, I've opted to build and design my own kiln. 

I've also opted to design and build my own refractory. Generally speaking, doing things like this from scratch is a surefire way to turn a simple project into an impossible one, but in this case, there's a good reason for the effort. Commercial refractory mix is expensive, mostly for the difficulty in moving a 50lb bag of powder in singles via UPS ground. Trying to source new mix locally through specialty pottery shops was no use either, as most places simply sold repair mix. I've instead opted to use materials either that are either commonly available at a big box type store, or cheaply available online.

When researching the design of my mix, I found a surprising amount of FUD on the Internet as to exactly how a good refractory mix is made, what constitutes a good mix, and how it should be validated.

For my design, I've opted to use a traditional alumina aggregate, held together by a sodium silicate binder. I've also looked into carbon foams and MgO/Alumina mixes.

In order to test the various materials, I intend to include detailed recipes to make a small test coupon of material.

Refractory mixes, silicates

Mix 1
```
	11.9g Vermiculite
	8.1g fireclay
	23.4g binder, 37.5% wt sodium metasilicate
```

The best mix thus far. Initial, unrecorded trials were significantly denser. THis refractory is airy and hard.

Mix 2
```
	15g vermiculite
	34.6 binder

	Dried in oven at 85C
```

mix 3
```
	15g vermiculite
	34.6 binder

	with pam coating mold, same as #2
	Dried in oven at 85C
```

mix 4
```
	15g vermiculite
	40.3g binder

	Dried in oven at 85C
```

mix 5
```
	15g vermiculite
	40.3g binder

	with pam coating mold, same as #2
	Dried in oven at 85C

	Failure, 2-5
```
Mixes 2-5 were total failures. After drying, I poured them (literately) out of the mold, as granular as when they went in. There simply was either not enough silicate, or something went wrong during the curing process, or both.

mix 6
```
	15g vermiculite
	45g binder
	Mold A tightly packed, mold B loosely packed
	Dried in oven at 85C overnight.
```
This mix was a redo of mix 4, with fresh 37.5% sodium silicate solution. I would like to see if this freshness of the solution makes a difference.

No difference. Total junk

mix 7
```
	15g vermiculite
	60g binder
a hard b light
	Dried in oven at 85C
```
Also testing 1:4 vermiculite to binder, in hopes that this mix will stick a bit more. No luck.

mix 8
```
	15g vermiculite
	30g binder
	15g fireclay
	Mold A tightly packed, mold B loosely packed
	Dried in oven at 85C overnight.
```
I think the fireclay may confer some additional strength to the mix, so I'm trying it out. This mix is similar to mix 1.

This mold came out fine.

mix 9
```
	15g vermiculite
	45g binder
	15g fireclay
	Mold A tightly packed, mold B loosely packed
	Dried in oven at 85C overnight.
```

Similar to 8, additional silicate binder. will compare densities and heat transmission.

Much harder to get out of the mold, might be a fluke.














I'll be using an [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50318176/) bathroom cabinet with an interior volume of 58L uninsulated. This provides for an convenient form factor and aesthetically pleasing case to hold brittle refractory.
