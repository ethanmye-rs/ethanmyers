There's a product called the [stickvise](http://www.stickvise.com/), designed to be a low profile PCB vise. It's a good idea, and a clean product. Normally, I would simply order one for $30 and get on with my life. But having a milling machine, aluminum stock and a desire to improve, I built my own.

I used extruded aluminum, milled down to approx 75x15x25mm. This gives me 3 blocks, one to use as a fixed jaw, one to use as a movable jaw, and the third to use as a spring loaded clamp. I could probably get away with nothing more than a collar, but I don't have a lathe (yet), so full block it is.
