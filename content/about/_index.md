My name is Ethan Myers and I'm a student at a large public research university in the US. This site is mostly for me to stay accountable to my projects, and for others to see them, if they so choose.

My résumé is viewable [here](/pdf/CV_USpdf).

The site is built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and a theme called [Cocoa](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/). It's hosted by [Netlify](netlify.com).
