My name is Ethan Myers and I'm a student at a large public research university in the US. This site is mostly for me to stay accountable to my projects, but also functions as a portfolio.

My résumé is viewable [here](/pdf/CV_US.pdf).

I can be reached via <ethan@ethanmye.rs>

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a theme called [Cocoa](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/). It's hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
