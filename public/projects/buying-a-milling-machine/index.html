                <p>As I move into more intensive and detailed projects, I increasing need to fabricate custom parts. Normally, I get through this with a 3D printer. It&rsquo;s allowed me to make objects far more complex than I can reliably make by hand. That being said, I&rsquo;m beginning to run up against the limitations of plastic and FDM printing. Even with wondermaterials like PET and HIPS, there&rsquo;s no easy way to build high temp / high precision / high accuracy / high stress / high wear parts. For something like bearing surfaces, 0.1mm just isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>

<p>Thus, I&rsquo;ve been trawling Craigslist for a few months looking for a mill. While I would have preferred a Bridgeport, there&rsquo;s fairly few in Colorado to choose from, and I simply do not have the space. Maybe in a few years.</p>

<p>That being said, I needed a mill beefy enough to chew through steel and heavy enough so I can take more than a 10 thou cut in aluminum without destroying the machine. A <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/two-speed-variable-bench-mill-drill-machine-44991.html">desktop hobby mill</a>, <a href="https://sherline.com/">Sherline</a> or <a href="https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve">X-Carve</a> just wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>

<p>Finally, I found a JET mill/drill from 1979 for sale on Craigslist for $800, negotiated down $100, and took it home. The machine was cast in Taiwan, and had seen remarkably little use. It&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;JET 16&rdquo;, and has a 12 speed belt drive and Morse Taper 3 (MT3). While not as popular as the R8 taper for most Bridgeport and newer import machines, it&rsquo;s easy enough to find tooling for.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mill/IMG_0558.JPG" alt="Mill" /></p>

<p>One of the most important factors for a machine tool is rigidity and dampening ability. Rigidity is obvious &ndash; good luck making straight parts when your machine is flexible and easily pushed around by the workpiece. On the other hand, dampening is a bit less obvious. People frequently use mass as a proxy for dampening ability, but this is only valid when we&rsquo;re talking about similar setups and identical materials.  <a href="http://www.atlasfdry.com/grayiron-damping.htm">here</a> are the relative dampening abilities of cast iron vs steel vs iron vs aluminum. Cast iron, even conservatively , is 2 orders of magnitude better than aluminum at absorbing vibrations.
Cast iron has both rigidity and dampening in spades. For machine tools, there is no simply substitute.</p>

<p>That being said, the JET is cast iron through and through. The gibs are cast iron, as well as the table, base and column. Despite the mill&rsquo;s superficial cleanliness, the ways were dirty with a mixture of old oil and old, never cleaned packing grease. I cleaned it all up with a bit of brakekleen, and relubricated the ways with Vactra #2 way oil. I also packed the leadscrews with lithium grease, as well as the thrust bearings.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m excited to use the mill in upcoming projects. It has immensely increased my ability to fabricate difficult pieces, as well as my ability to take on longer, more involved projects.</p>
