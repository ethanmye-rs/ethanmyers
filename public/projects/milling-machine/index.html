                <p>As I move into more intensive and detailed projects, I increasing need to fabricate custom parts. Normally, I get through this with a 3D printer. It&rsquo;s allowed me to make objects far more complex than I can reliably make by hand. That being said, I&rsquo;m beginning to run up against the limitations of plastic. Even with wondermaterials like PET and HIPS, there&rsquo;s no easy way to build high temp / high precision / high accuracy / high stress / high wear parts. For bearing surfaces, 0.1mm just isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>

<p>Thus, I&rsquo;ve been trawling Craigslist for a few months looking for a mill. While I would have preferred (immensely) a Bridgeport, there&rsquo;s fairly few in Colorado to choose from, and I simply do not have the space. Maybe in a few years.</p>

<p>That being said, I needed a mill beefy enough to chew through steel and heavy enough so I can take more than a 10 thou cut in aluminum without destroying the machine. A desktop hobby mill, Sherline or x-carve just wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>

<p>Finally, I found a JET mill/drill from 1979 for sale on Craigslist for $800, negotiated down $100, and took it home. The machine was cast in Taiwan, and had seen remarkably little use. It&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;JET 16&rdquo;, and has a 12 speed belt drive.

<p>Despite its age, I&rsquo;m the third owner. Despite being clean on the surface, the ways were dirty with a mixture of oil and old, never cleaned packing grease. I cleaned it all up with some degreaser and a bit of brakekleen, and relubricated the ways with Vactra #2. I also lubricated the leadscrews with lithium grease, as well as the thrust bearings.</p>
