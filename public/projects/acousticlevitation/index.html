    Piezoelectric Acoustic Leviation

                <p>Because tinnitus is for the old, I decided to build an acoustic levitator. Essentially, the idea is to set up a standing wave and use that to hold small objects in the air at each node. Do it at a high enough frequency and a high enough power and you can hold small Styrofoam pellets, bits of packing peanuts, etc.</p>

<p>The main design centers around a piezo transducer, resonant at around 40kHz (this depends on loading, coupling etc and should be tuned). This is well outside the range of human hearing; it is not outside the range of damage. You should definitely wear ear plugs or other hearing protection if you build something similar.</p>

<p>Driving the transducer is somewhat tricky. A sine wave is ideal, but a square wave will do. It needs to be fairly high voltage (~200V pk-pk) and at a reasonable power &ndash; 20W would be optimal.</p>

<p>To do so, I&rsquo;ve split the design into two parts. The first is a basic h-bridge designed to drive a transformer. I&rsquo;ve included the <a href="https://github.com/hasxz/ADP3120A">link</a> to a Github repo that details the construction and includes schematics for the h-bridge. To save you a click, it&rsquo;s composed of two half bridge drivers (originally designed for motherboard buck converters), a few passives, and 4 N channel FETs, rated for 60V at 6A e/a. This forms the first stage, producing a 24V square wave that&rsquo;s fed into the transformer.</p>

<p>As for sourcing the transformer, I&rsquo;m back driving an old high power UPS transformer. I would recommend something with a 2x or 3x higher power rating than you need, transformers are built to have very, very poor characteristics outside of their specified currents and frequencies.</p>

<p>The second stage consists of a rectifier, capacitor and chopper. The diode prevents back flow into the transformer, and the capacitor smooths out the voltage to produce a steady 200V supply. The chopper then produces a square wave with a duty cycle as set by the controller (in this case, an Arduino). This square wave is then fed into the piezo and the chopper frequency adjusted until resonance is reached.</p>

<p>The Github repo also contains the code for this project, which consists of a simple Arduino sketch the manipulates ICR1 to produce two PWM signals with customizable dead-time by directly manipulating the registers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
