    The best t-shirts $4 can buy

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Like every other college student on the planet, I wear a lot of t-shirts. Naturally, I have my favorites, but every shirt eventually wears out. My tees tend to be a hodgepodge of university sponsored swag, random souvenirs, and clothing bought from a smattering of retailers in styles they no longer carry. Needless to say, when a shirt wears out, it&rsquo;s difficult, if not impossible, to find a replacement.</p>

<p>In a world of standardized parts, this simply won&rsquo;t do, so in the interests of frugality and comfort, I&rsquo;ve decided to figure out who makes the best, widely available and standardized t-shirt $4 can buy. I&rsquo;ll be looking primarily at longevity, but also price, color range, as well as general fit and finish. I&rsquo;ll build a total score for my shirts, and my thoughts on each one. This is mostly for me, but I hope it helps you find the your new favorite cheap t-shirt.</p>

<p>In my initial survey, I tried to find tees in my closet I loved and use that as a starting point for picking new shirts. By far, the most popular two types were 100% cotton and a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> (sometimes <sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub>) mix of cotton and polyester.</p>

<p>100% Cotton Tees are</p>

<ul>
<li>cheap</li>
<li>recyclable and generally eco-friendly</li>
<li>may shrink, most brands have preshrunk versions</li>
<li>very soft</li>
<li>less durable than polyester versions</li>
</ul>

<p>Cotton / Polyester Tees are</p>

<ul>
<li>almost as cheap</li>
<li>not easily recyclable</li>
<li>no shrink</li>
<li>almost as soft</li>
<li>more durable than 100% cotton</li>
</ul>

<p>50 / 50 cotton shirts, on the other hand, have a similar fit and feel to cotton tees, but are more durable, wrinkle resistant, and color fast. They don&rsquo;t shrink nearly as much, and generally cost about the same as a cotton tee, maybe a bit more.</p>

<p>I bought ~ 11 shirts from a company called <a href="https://www.shirtsupplier.com/">Shirt Supplier</a> for $36, including shipping. This is a breakdown of each type of shirt I ordered. I tried to avoid black and white shirts, as the fabric content of those two colors tends to be somewhat different from the other colors.</p>

<p>I refer to all shirts by their style number, not the style name.</p>

<h3 id="initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h3>

<p>All shirts fit suprisingly well. Every shirt is incredibly soft, with the corsest being the Hanes 5170 (but not by much). Fits and finishes are excellent &ndash; no loose thread in my order at all, and all of the shirts fit almost identically, with the 4980 seeminly running a bit longer. In short, the shirts are basically undifferentiated right now &ndash; time will tell how well each one holds up!</p>

<p>In the future, I would also like to try a few other brands &ndash; Anvil, Fruit of the Loom, Next Level, and LAT.</p>
