    Juul Pods

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Vaping, for better of worse, has supplanted smoking at least among the youth. It&rsquo;s <em>probably</em> less dangerous for you, but the addictive kick still remains.</p>

<p>Chief among the new purveyors of vape is a company called <a href="https://www.juul.com/">Juul</a>. They make these sleek little devices, the eponymously named Juul. They&rsquo;ve got this clean, undeniably sleek, Johnny-Ive-would&rsquo;ve-loved-it dark anodized aluminum aesthetic &ndash; and they&rsquo;re covert to boot. They take a single serve, Keurig-inspired pod, and fill it with proprietary liquid, containing a whopping <a href="https://support.juul.com/home/learn/faqs/juulpods-juulpod-liquid">59mg</a> of nicotine &ndash; about as much as a pack of cigarettes.</p>

<p>Juul, which raised some <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/juul-labs-raising-150-million-in-debt-after-spinning-out-of-pax.html">$110 million</a>, is not out to make smoking any less expensive. Their business model is not unlike printer ink &ndash; give the device away for free, then charge through the nose for pods. Those little pods, containing a mere 0.7ml of liquid, retail for about $4 a piece (for reference, this works out to about $15,000 per gallon of liquid). That being said, there is no real reason for these pods to be so expensive, so I decided to reverse engineer them, mostly to satisfy my idle curiosity.</p>

<h1 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h1>

<p>E-Liquid/vape juice is basically a mix of vegetable glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) plus some other secret sauce ingredients. Both VG and PG are common food additives used as humectants in a stunning variety of food products, from cookies to cake to Twinkies. Most e-liquids also use some type of flavoring, and most add nicotine.</p>

<p>Juul&rsquo;s innovation, if you can call it that, is in the nicotine. They&rsquo;ve figured out how to pack <strong>very</strong> high doses of nicotine into very small amounts of liquid. However, doing this isn&rsquo;t easy with a freebase form of nicotine &ndash; a high concentration of freebase nicotine is extremely harsh and unpleasant to smoke. Doses of more than 10mg/mL would be unusable for most. What Juul figured out was the conversion of the freebase form into a salt form &ndash; not unlike turning crack into cocaine. In fact, it&rsquo;s actually the <em>exact same</em> fundamental process, albeit dressed up with slightly different chemicals. Essentially, we are taking the freebase form of nicotine and using an acid to turn it into a salt. The pure (freebase form) amine is slightly basic, so the addition of acid results in an acid-base reaction, making our nicotine salt. This salt will be easier to absorb as well as negating the &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; effect of high nicotine content.</p>

<p>The specifics of this are pretty interesting. We need a couple of things. The first is a water soluble, food safe, high (&gt;200C) decomposition temp, low cost commercially available acid. Juul mentions most of the good ones in the patent, and even a couple that cannot conceivably work.</p>

<p>I decided to delve into Juul Pods to address two big issues: waste and nicotine concentration. In terms of waste, these little pods are everywhere, so much so that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/">reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing</a> logo is a juul pod. In terms of nicotine concentration, I think Juul labs has done a disservice to people attempting to use the device to quit. It is straightforward to build a 18 week program to decrease the nicotine content without the user noticing. However, this obviously goes against their business interests, and they will not do so.</p>

<h5 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h5>

<p>Juul has patented this idea, and the patent covers a wide variety of acids and PG/VG mixes. In publishing this information, I believe this falls under the research exemption provided for patents. I have no profit motive &ndash; just idle curiosity. If you&rsquo;re interested in making some Juul pod juice, I&rsquo;ve laid out several formulations that I believe are about 80 to 90% there, and can be infinitely tweaked.</p>

<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need quite a bit of equipment, but a majority of it is low cost. total BOM, including tools, should come to less than $75.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found this recipe to be fairly satisfactory, but I went through approximately ~10 different formulations before finding something good.</p>

<pre><code>1000uL VG Nicotine Solution 48mg/mL
0.08g Sodium Benzoate
100uL Berry Flavoring
300uL Vegetable Glycerin
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you fully mix all ingredients. You can warm up the solution to decrease viscosity and enable easier mixing.</p>

<h1 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h1>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually smoke, so this isn&rsquo;t a project I&rsquo;ll be pursing in the future. However, I think there are several avenues worth pursuing. Notably &ndash; synthetic nicotine, which lacks the impurities that affect flavor in commercially available extracted nicotine, compound acid mixtures (i.e, a mixture of malic acid and benzoic acid), reduced nicotine levels, novel carriers, etc.</p>
