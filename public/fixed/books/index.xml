      <description>Concrete Planet, Robert Courland
A good book, but a flawed finale.
Concrete Planet is, no surprise, about concrete. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less a history of the material, describing the initial discovery of quicklime by early man to the the development of hydraulic cements such as Roman cement and Portland cement. Courland works his way thru the development of both, describing the relevant contextual histories of each development &amp;ndash; mainly the geographies and people that drove the development.</description>

      <description>Fooled By Randomness, Nicholas Taleb
Fundamentally, the books boils down to the idea that people are shit at estimating risk, and even worse, regularly try to fit a normal model to anything that walks and talks. This results in some pretty funny, if financially catastrophic, fallout.
Fine, fair enough, and a pretty interesting topic for a book. That being said, Taleb&amp;rsquo;s arrogance throughout the book is unnecessary and distracts from his message.</description>
