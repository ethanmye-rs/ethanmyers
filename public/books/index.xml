      <description>Fooled By Randomness, Nicholas Taleb
Fundamentally, the books boils down to the idea that people are shit at estimating risk, and even worse, regularly try to fit a normal model to anything that walks and talks. This results in some pretty funny, if financially catastrophic, fallout.
Fine, fair enough, and a pretty interesting topic for a book. That being said, Taleb&amp;rsquo;s arrogance throughout the book is unnecessary and distracts from his message.</description>
