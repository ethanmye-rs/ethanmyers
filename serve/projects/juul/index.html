    Cloning Juul Pods

                <p>#Background</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on a college campus anywhere in the US recently, you may have noticed an annoyingly sweet vapor emanating from a discrete aluminum stick borne of Johnny Ive&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Juul. Juul is trying to both legitimize and professionalize vaping. Long gone are the halcyon days of oversized battery packs, flamboyant glass tanks, and a subculture of intense devotion.</p>

<p>The future will be served single serve.</p>

<p>Each Juul &ldquo;pod&rdquo; contains nearly 59mg of Nicotine, comparable to a pack of cigarettes &ndash; and priced to compete. They are not refillable and almost totally self contained. As of March 2018, Juul offers no nicotine free options.</p>

<p>In terms of construction, the Juul pod is suprising impressive. Each pod contains a minaturized wick, coil, stem, and holding tank, which holds about 0.7mL of juice. All the user does is slot the pod into the Juul itself, which provides the power needed to vaporize a small amount of liquid. This system is reminiscent of a Keruig Pod (but worse). Each of these self contained systems is capable of being reused several times, but designed exclusively for single serve consumption.</p>

<p>The real kicker is the cost. Commercially available Nicotine solution is available for around $0.05 per mL, and flavorings and fillers for even less. With a pack of 4 running for about $16, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why Pax Labs raised a $50M series C. represents a fashionable and sleek way to lure in a new generation of smokers, brought up in the age of D.A.R.E and graphic anti-smoking ads.</p>

<p>As a primer, &ldquo;E-Juice&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s know, is a mixture of Vegetable Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, nicotine, and flavoring. VG and PG are serosolized to create a mist of visable vapor, which serves as a carrier for both the valor and nicotine.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t resist a good reverse engineering, so I set to reading. Essentially, Juul is trying to produce a very &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; experience by turning freebase nicotine into a salt form. Not unlike turning crack into cocaine, the belief is that a salt form produces a better buzz and allows for higher nicotine dosage whilst reducing &ldquo;throat hit&rdquo;.</p>
